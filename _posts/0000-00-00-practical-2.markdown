In the second assignment we will tackle the task of digit recognition.
We will work on the classic MNIST dataset and implement the venerable K nearest neighbour (K-NN) algorithm.
We will 
1. see how to use cross-validation to find the optimal value for the parameter K;
2. implement some evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall);
3. diagnose the results by visualizing the first negative example and the last positive example.
