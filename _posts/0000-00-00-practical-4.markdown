Learning algorithms, such as the perceptron or logistic regression, are linear models.
Non-linear models have, however, better separation power.
In this lecture we will see how to turn a linear model into a non-linear one by explicitly embedding its features into a higher dimensional space.
For complex data (images, sound, text) the most powerful features include non-linear steps.
Finally, we will look at neural networks and deep learning and see how they learn such powerful, non-linear features.

## Explicit embeddings

* Polynomial features

## Implicit embeddings

* Kernels
* Kernelizing logisitic regression.

## Examples of features

* Image
* Sound
* Text
