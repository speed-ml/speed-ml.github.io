First, on a two-dimensional dataset we will change the input of a linear classification algorithm to explicitly embedded features (e.g., polynomial features).
We will visualize the decision boundary and see that, indeed, it's non-linear.

Second, we will work on task of action recognition.
We will use the provided features, which are extracted from different modalities (appearance, motion, audio), to train classifiers for the various actions.
We will investigate which modalities are better suited for which actions and we will combine the classifiers to improve the performance.
