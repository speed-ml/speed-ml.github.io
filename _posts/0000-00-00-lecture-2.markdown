In the second lecture we will delve into the practicalities of machine learning.
We will look at how to test and evaluate our models using various metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
The most important quality of a learning algorithm is its generalization capability.
We will see that a common cause of poor performance is the phenomenon of overfitting, when the algorithm just "memorizes" the train data; we will look at a couple of ways of preventing overfitting through cross-validation and regularization.

## Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall

## Overfitting

* What is overfitting?
* Solution to overfitting: validation
* Solution to overfitting: regularization

## Curse of dimensionality
