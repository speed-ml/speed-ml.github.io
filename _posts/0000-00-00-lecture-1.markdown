We start off with a gentle introduction into machine learning.
This lecture aims to motivate the course and provide the big picture.
First, we showcase examples and applications of machine learning (e.g., face detection, spam classification, recommender systems).
Second, we present: (i) various types of learning; (ii) the relation between machine learning and related disciplines; (iii) the ingredients of a learning algorithm.
Finally, we will introduce our first learning algorithm, the decision trees.

## Examples 

* Face detection
* Spam classification
* Recommender systems.

Quiz:
Can you come up with another example?
Why would you count it as machine learning?

## Types of learning

* Supervised learning
* Unsupervised learning
* Semi-supervised learning
* Reinforcement learning
