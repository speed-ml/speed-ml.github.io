In the first assignment we will play with a small and interpretable dataset, such as, Iain Murray's Orange and Lemons dataset, and perform tasks that include:

1. data visualisations;
2. implementing a classification algorithm by setting thresholds;
3. implementing a classification algorithm by learning the thresholds (a simple decision tree).

For the classification algorithms, we will visualize their decision boundaries and investigate the errors (the misclassified data points).
