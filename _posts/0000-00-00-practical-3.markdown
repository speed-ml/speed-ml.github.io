For this assignment we will implement the logistic regression algorithm.
We will make use of basic linear algebra to compute the gradient of the loss function (see the Matrix Cookbook).
Then we will check the gradient by comparing it to numerically differentiating the loss function.
In order to find the optimal parameters of the logistic regression we will implement the gradient descent method.
